# 🎯 Closest Vote Finder – Open House Edition

Welcome to the **Closest Vote Finder** – a fun and interactive tool built for our **Student Service Center Open House Event**! 🎉

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As part of a small event at our student center, we asked guests to **guess how many students would attend**. The person whose guess is **closest to the actual number** wins a **small gift card**! 🎁

I created this tool to:
- Automatically calculate the closest guess
- Make it easy to add or remove guesses
- Provide a fun and fair way to pick a winner

But more than that — I wanted to apply what I’ve learned from my **Data Structures & Algorithms** class into a real-world problem. This project uses **binary search** and a **hashmap** to efficiently determine the winner.

And yes... I'm really happy and proud to have built this from scratch! 😊
